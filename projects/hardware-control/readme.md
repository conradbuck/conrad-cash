# Hardware Control Interface Reference

This is all of the code that I use to have responsive and accurate hardware interfaces.

The code in this repo has samples for these hardware interfaces:
- rotary encoders
- momentary push button interfaces

This repo includes code for various system architectures for use in embedded systems:
- real time delay with software interrupts
