ChatGPT for hardware, generate your first physical prototype with AI

UX: Drop in a datasheet for all the parts you are using and it will generate firmware and wiring schematics to get you started. Or describe your product vision and gpt will suggest parts to use and generate breadboard designs to help you make the first prototype.

Firmware: chat gpt can already do this but if it can automatically find the right libraries and write a program using them, that would be cool

Hardware: would need to have implementation specific awareness, i.e. if chatgpt notices that the primary data interface with a chip is i2c, it will look for suggested pullup resistor values, if it can’t find any, it would use common values, like 4.7k. (we would need some kind of convention library to inform these decisions)

Would need to default to breadboard mode, provide graphics for wiring schemes, could pretty easily be converted to a PCB generator. [reference image]

AI powered PCB generators exist, but this tool would suggest components and generate prototype designs and firmware that will work out of the box to let you rapidly iterate on your idea. I’m thinking this would be used by Elia making a VR vibration wristband rather than an LG engineer designing an LCD controller.

Problems: its made for people making PCBs and aren’t starting from 0 electronics exp.

Example:
Prompt: I want to make a vibrational wristband that I can trigger a pulse using my laptop.

Return:
-suggested parts (with pictures and purchase links)
  -esp32
  -haptic motor driver
  -coin style haptic motor
-suggested project structure
  -tells you that the esp will interface with your computer via 
   bluetooth, maybe generates a block diagram of how each 
   component integrates with the next
-wiring diagram showing you how to plug stuff into 
 breadboard
  -maybe it throws an LED on there for debugging help, but 
   adds a note of what it does and why it may not be required 
   in case you dont have one on hand
-several firmware files that use a library that works on the 
 esp32 with the suggested driver chip
  -first file would be a Hello_world test to see if you wired 
   everything correctly (it blinks the LED, tries to initialize 
   driver)
  -second file is full of building blocks, it includes some 
   objects that make it easy to interface with the haptic motor 
   and add on your code as necessary
-finally generates a script file using python that interfaces with your laptop’s bluetooth chip to connect to the esp32 and send it a command to trigger a pulse on the wristband
